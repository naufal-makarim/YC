Pandai provides gamified quizzes aligned to a specific school curriculum, from which students can learn, practice, get feedback, and diagnose their weaknesses. üî• Why do we build this? In Southeast Asia, the education system is competitive and exam-oriented. There is a huge demand for interventions (tutors, workbooks, and extra classes) to help students perform better in school. Pandai fills the demand with a solution that is better than the alternatives. üë®‚Äçüè´ Who We Are The three founders are based in Malaysia and have known each other since high school, 23 years ago. After we graduated (from MIT & other US colleges), we started our first education company in 2007, focusing on coaching school students in STEM subjects. We worked closely with students (many of them from underprivileged backgrounds) and saw firsthand the impact we‚Äôve had on them. We then realized that with technology, we could reach more students and bring more impact. Hence, we released Pandai in 2020. üöÄ Present & Future Currently, we have launched in our home ground Malaysia in 2020. So far, 280,000 students have completed 83 million questions on Pandai, and 92% of users have seen some improvement in their academic performance. We plan to expand to Southeast Asia and other emerging markets, a market of 100M+ school students.

76. ancana : With Ancana, you can own a 1/4 or 1/8 share of the home and split expenses with the other co-owners. If you buy a 1/4 share of a home, you have access to it for 3 months of the year. For each property we set up the investment trust, find qualified co-owners, and handle the entire real estate purchase transaction. Costs are split amongst the co-owners, and we take care of the furnishing and ongoing property management. We accomplish this by creating an investment trust for each property and dividing it into individual, purchasable shares that represent ownership in the property. We furnish each home and find and vet the co-owners. Once all of the shares of the property are sold, we retain no ownership stake in the property and transition into the role of property manager, ensuring the home is well maintained and handling any issues that arise. Unlike a timeshare, Ancana owners own a real asset (the property) versus a block of time. If you decide you want to sell your share, you are free to do so at any time, either through us or on the open market, and capture any appreciation the property has accrued.

Finally, they confirm the deal, buy the items, deliver them and earn money. Shoppers on the other hand, search items from their favorite websites and fill out the item description. Then they give their location and find a traveler coming to their city. Finally they "request backpack" and confirm the deal. Within days they can get the product and save money. backpack is founded with a vision to provide every citizen of the world with a choice; the choice of buying organic, authentic, and cost effective products with minimum friction.

148. acunote : 
149. 1849-bio : 1849 bio designs microbes enabling cheap metal extraction allowing miners to unlock value from low quality copper and gold ores. Surprisingly, the mining industry is one of the largest scale users of biotech in the world with biomining processes accounting for ~1% of global copper production. Biomining is ultra-low cost, running around ~$1/ton of ore vs ~$7/ton for conventional processes. Unfortunately, while biomining is cheap, it can‚Äôt be applied to over 80% of copper ores, leaving vast resources without profitable extraction methods. An estimated ~$800B of copper sit today in waste materials and stockpiles with negative unit economics. While a great deal of effort has been spent on optimizing microbial metal extraction processes, very little effort has been spent on optimizing the microbes themselves. To change that, we‚Äôre creating new biotech tools and platforms applied directly to the types of biology most relevant to miners. This enables us to develop new microbes and tackle some of the most difficult problems in biomining, unlocking billions in value from unprofitable resources while being more environmentally friendly than conventional processes. We‚Äôre world class microbial engineers.

195. seaflight-technologies : Seaflight Technologies has developed a new form of Aerodynamic Flow Control for electrified aircraft that increases range and payload by 30%. That's the same performance improvement you'd get from hopping in a DeLorean to 2035 and coming back with batteries from the future. But it's available today - our tech has been derisked by testing supported by the National Science Foundation, the US Air Force, and the Australian Government. Our first product is a simple fixed-wing large cargo drone that is efficient enough to remove the "green penalty" currently associated with electric aviation. That's a step change from today's conventional platforms. First generation electric aircraft are heavy, expensive, complicated, and limited in terms of range and payload. In the entire history of aviation, that's never been a winning formula. When everyone already has access to the same batteries, materials, and motors, what really makes the difference? The answer is revolutionary aerodynamics, but in a form factor that suits today's operations and manufacturing. Beyond our own drone product line, we have partners across Aerospace helping incorporate our tech into their products. In the future, if you want to have the most efficient and cost-effective flying machine of any description, you'll need Seaflight's Flow Control inside.

Nearly 3 out of 4 millennials would rather go to the dentist than listen to their bank. While it's possible that we just really love our oral hygiene, it's more likely that we don't trust or like our banks. It's not hard to understand why. Big banks use big budgets and armies of salespeople and marketers to sell old-school products layered with fees and penalties. Their profits increase when we spend more, overuse debt, and make mistakes like overdrafting. Big banks get away with this because banking is such a vital service. Everyday spending and saving decisions that begin at the checking account ultimately determine whether we'll lead a healthy and secure financial life. What can be done? Bill Gates believes banks aren't necessary for banking. Millennials believe technology companies can make banking better. So let's build a better bank. Cheddar is a new mobile bank account, debit card, and business model to free the world from underpowered checking accounts and evil banks.

Our initial target market is sorority girls who can have up to 3-4 events per week that they need a new outfit/dress for. One of our core theses is that this idea couldn‚Äôt have existed at scale until now because resale apps like Depop & Poshmark paved the way for a P2P model to work after familiarizing users with the process of taking pictures of items, shipping, etc. Advantages to our P2P model - Entrepreneur-led - Similar to Depop, most of our growth will be spearheaded by a group of ‚Äútop renters‚Äù - More variety in inventory - Existing rental companies like Rent the Runway own all the inventory so they're limited to the brands they buy/partner with. Since we're P2P, our users can rent any item or brand that's in someone else's closet - Better margins - we don‚Äôt touch any inventory or deal with the cleaning of any items - Unlike Rent the Runway, we don‚Äôt handle any inventory or the cleaning of items. This means people renting out their clothing on Dressd are responsible for shipping things out & returning them in good condition Here are some of our links!

447. bountiful : We‚Äôre on a mission to optimize the agricultural industry. When we started Bountiful in 2015, the grape error rate for predicting production was 30 percent. Why? We found that many farmers in the specialty crops space were still using traditional pencil-and-paper techniques to predict yield. These low-fidelity forecasting methods weren‚Äôt giving them a clear enough understanding of their production until it was too late, leading to waste and inefficiency throughout the supply chain. We saw a problem we wanted to solve. Today, Bountiful is using advanced data science to help farmers forecast more accurately, so they can make better decisions. In the last three years, we‚Äôve combined the latest in machine learning with weather, satellite, geographic, and historical data. The result is a user-friendly platform that transforms volumes of complex agricultural information into simple, actionable insights farmers can use to run more economically and environmentally sustainable farms. More recently, we‚Äôre working to open the dialogue between buyers and sellers, remove uncertainty, and provide clarity to the supply chain to meet global food demand. Our ultimate goal is to close the agricultural margin of error. Not only will this make individual farms more efficient, profitable, and sustainable, but it will help optimize the global food supply chain. That means healthier people and a healthier planet.

624. cisterna-biologics : Founded in 2022 and based in San Diego, California, Cisterna Biologics is a technology company. It aims to solve some of the challenges currently facing the biotech industry to develop mRNA-based therapeutics ‚Äì quality, quantity, longevity and cost of mRNA. As mRNA technology matures, it becomes imperative that these issues are solved so we can fully explore mRNA's endless possibilities as a therapeutic. Cisterna uses proprietary technologies to either remove a contaminant at its source or replace the source itself. For example, to remove double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), we use ribozymes - molecular scissors - to precisely cut the mRNA at its 3‚Äô end. This assures not only 3‚Äô homogeneity, but also eliminates dsRNA, which are primarily produced due to self-templated additions at the 3‚Äô end. Utilizing a PCR-like system to amplify the DNA template in large quantities eliminates the requirement for plasmid enrichment in bacteria, the prime source of endotoxin contamination. These are just a few examples of Cisterna‚Äôs powerful technologies being used to achieve our goal of 10x higher quality mRNA for therapeutic application.

802. pap : Consumers miss out on $70B+ every year because they're busy and unaware, and that money is sitting in their email inbox. So, we automated reading email receipts and claiming the money they're entitled to, offering a service to which you can sign up once, do (literally) nothing, and earn $. Where is this money coming from? - Retailers: When the price of clothes or furniture you've already bought drops, you're entitled to a refund for the difference - Airlines: When a flight you've booked gets delayed or canceled, you're entitled to a cash compensation. - Enterprises: When a class-action lawsuit is filed against a company you engage with, you're entitled to money. - And many more, that even the government holds some of your unclaimed funds. Today, the dream of one service that automatically claims the money you deserve when you shop, fly,... and live is (finally) possible. We started with automating refunds in the shopping industry and have secured $8,000 in refunds to our users, growing 233% MoM. With AI, we've been able to repurpose that same automation to tackle refunds in the flight industry and the class-action lawsuit landscape. Why us?

823. rocketable : Rocketable is building a large portfolio of wildly profitable software businesses by acquiring existing products and replacing human teams with AI agents. Today‚Äôs foundation models already possess enough intelligence to automate most of the tasks required to run a profitable software business. In the functions where agents aren‚Äôt yet intelligent enough to replace humans, they will be soon. When every human function required to operate a software product has an AI agent equivalent, the next step will be within reach: operating an entire company with a team of AI agents instead of humans. But superintelligent agents within each function won‚Äôt be enough. To operate a software company with 0 human employees, the agents will need to be directed towards common goals, integrated to collaborate across functions, tuned with feedback loops connected to product metrics, and trained to make resource allocation decisions. We are creating the tools needed to replace the entire org chart of a software company with a team of AI agents. We are developing these tools by owning the products that we automate, because we know from 10+ years of experience building automated systems with AI/ML that integration is the key to unlocking superhuman performance.

848. seneca-systems : Every day, incredible government workers serve the public without the resources‚Äîand appreciation‚Äîtheir important work deserves. These hard-working teams have to deal with communications arriving from too many channels, maze-like processes for fulfilling constituent requests, and a dangerous lack of visibility into constituent opinions on major issues and the work teams perform.

Our virus-free gene editing platform allows us to engineer a dose of CAR-T cell therapy for ~$500, and brings the promise of a curative outcome. Given our safety and efficacy data to date, we believe this product could be used by general practice veterinarians, meaning we have thousands of customers all across the USA who typically treat with palliative care or refer cancer patients to specialty oncologists. Our CAR-T cell platform is regulated by the USDA, not the FDA, affording us a cost effective "full stack" to iterate and innovate on CAR-T cell therapy from a hypothesis through clinical validation.
860. easyplan : Easyplan is an investment app for beginner investors in India (kind of a cross between Betterment and Qapital in the US). We also provide users with a credit card secured by their investments. We launched with money market funds and have ~40,000 customers who‚Äôve invested (~40% MoM growth). The pandemic spurred interest among new investors, and our AUM has grown 3x since April 2020. And we‚Äôve done this with a cost of acquisition that is 10% of the industry average. Here‚Äôs the problem we see. Only 10% of the 100 million middle-income Indian workers have invested in the markets. This is despite the fact that they save ~30% of their income, making this a $325B potential market in assets under management. However, current investment apps in India are built for active investors. With over 16,000+ mutual funds and 5000+ stocks to choose from, they are far too complicated for beginners, who make up most of the market. We‚Äôre building an AI - driven investment planning software that is designed for beginners. Users use our conversational AI to get diversified mutual fund portfolios tailored to their goals. We also offer users a credit card secured by their investments, so they can earn return without losing liquidity. In terms of business model, we make commissions on the asset we manage, and interchange fees on the fund. We estimate we can make $12 per user per year, which is 6x our current acquisition cost of $2 per investor.

We launched in India 60 days ago and have grown from 0 to 40k transacting users and hit a monthly GTV of $280K already. We are growing 25% week on week. India is a nation of savers but the way the majority of India saves is non-smart & does not create wealth. There are 200 Mn Indians who save manually in bank deposits, the returns from these instruments do not even beat India's inflation. Gold is an instrument that India loves - 30Bn worth gold is purchased in India every year by middle income households. Gold has great cultural significance in India & there is high familiarity with the asset class. Despite gold being a familiar asset class & giving 5% higher returns than bank deposits, 200 Mn Indians still save manually in these non wealth creating bank deposits. This is largely because the ways to save in Gold required painful discrete activities such as manually accumulating money to buy gold, going to offline stores to buy this gold, incurring storage charges & more. The minimum ticket size for purchasing gold at these stores is $50 adding to more friction to saving in Gold. Using automated savings, Gullak now makes it extremely easy for users to save small amounts regularly($1/day) in digital Gold.This was not possible a year ago because the underlying infrastructure(UPI Autopay) was missing. With 50 Mn Indians saving $2/day & with gold backed lending, this is a $1.5Bn market opportunity. Gullak‚Äôs Founding team is the team which built BHIM UPI App(10Mn Downloads in 10 Days), this was launched by the PM of India. We built large scale payment systems for partners like GooglePay / Amazon, processing more than 30Mn payments/day.

1014. village-labs : At Village Labs, we help America's businesses become employee owned by helping them set up and manage an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP).

With 2.9M Baby Boomer business owners set to retire in the coming years, there's a growing "Silver Tsunami" of businesses across the country in search of new ownership. For many of these owners, selling to their employees is a socially-minded yet financially pragmatic solution. By selling ownership of their business to an ESOP, owners get a fair price, tax benefits, and the satisfaction of knowing their employees and legacy will be taken care of ‚Äî things not guaranteed with traditional buyers like private equity. In turn, employees retain their jobs and get shares in the business that can help them create life changing wealth by the time they retire ‚Äî imagine an office secretary retiring as a millionaire. Thousands of businesses across America like Bob's Red Mill, Harpoon Brewery, and Recology already have an ESOP, benefiting over 14 million workers and creating 2.1 trillion in employee wealth.

Their technology is outdated, their source code proprietary and their security vulnerabilities ‚Äì described in detail by the security community over many years ‚Äì are left unpatched. It‚Äôs not surprising that 76% of voters are concerned that our elections are vulnerable to hacking. And if voters lose trust in elections, then the very foundation of our democracy is at risk. We‚Äôre using open-source software, off-the-shelf hardware, and modern product engineering to make elections dramatically safer, more accessible, and more affordable. Affordability may sound pedestrian, but it is key. The front line of America‚Äôs election security rests in the hands of the 50% of US counties that struggle to afford basic services, let alone upgrade aging voting equipment.

That‚Äôs where we learned that 73% of people who find a hotel room on Booking.com or Expedia also check the hotel website to see if the price is cheaper. Independent hotels are missing these opportunities because they haven‚Äôt figured out that they should offer extras, discounts, and better user experience in order to drive bookings on their websites to avoid paying 15-25% commissions to OTAs. We help them automate all of this. Why now - Shopify did this for e-commerce allowing them to pull their content from Amazon - we will do this for hotels allowing them to gain freedom from Booking and Expedia.
1553. sidenote : Sidenote is a Chrome extension that turns meeting notes into drafted emails, calendar invites, tickets, and reminders.
1554. equator-therapeutics : We are developing a drug to increase metabolism and burn calories without exercise. Obesity and type 2 diabetes have reached epidemic proportions. There are 2.2B overweight people and 500M people with type 2 diabetes worldwide, and these numbers increase drastically every year. Existing drugs are not effective enough to reverse the trend. Our drug can solve this problem, because it addresses the root cause of metabolic disorders ‚Äì the imbalance between caloric intake and expenditure. Our drug will target mitochondria ‚Äì the powerhouse of the cell ‚Äì to generate heat. This approach has been proven to fully reverse obesity and type 2 diabetes in animals. However, therapeutic application for humans was impossible, because mitochondrial heat production could only be induced by highly artificial methods with side effects. This changed after our recent breakthrough discovery of the protein that mitochondria naturally use to generate heat. We have developed a unique high-throughput drug discovery platform to identify compounds that selectively activate this target protein, without side effects. For decades people have wanted a drug that burns calories like exercise does. We are realizing this dream at Equator Therapeutics.

I was able to use the resources KickUp created for a board report and now the district is interested in seeing how all of the other departments can benefit from their services. We are in need of someone who can take that step back and see the big picture of what we are trying to accomplish with professional development, effective student learning, and assessment and tie it all together for us in ways that make sense. KickUp has become the connector between departments, helping to lead us all in our common goal, to improve learning for our students.

Every year, nearly 50% all truck space goes unused annually in the almost $1T US trucking industry. On the other hand, SMBs represent 44% of the US GDP and are historically forced to deal with high freight rates and friction due to their small size compared to enterprise businesses. With trucking being a hyper-fragmented market (90%+ of US trucking companies are small family businesses), we decided to build an ecosystem that takes all of this inefficiency and turns it into something that could fundamentally transform the livelihoods of businesses and drivers alike. Oway is designed to be simple (you can place an order in 30 seconds) and scale with your business. Our ML rideshare protocol now allows businesses to ship freight affordably and faster than ever before. We also improve the survivability of independent truckers by maximizing their revenue when they‚Äôre already on the road - and it‚Äôs great for the environment too. üçÉ

Why Now? We're witnessing a perfect storm of factors: decades of stagnation in traditional ERP systems, a multi-billion-dollar industry built on misaligned incentives, and the transformative potential of AI. This confluence creates a rare cyclical opportunity for market upheaval. The last major shift in this space occurred in the 1990s with the advent of digital systems, and now, 30 years later, we're on the cusp of another seismic change. Customers are crying out for innovation and as AI reshapes the landscape, early customer signals indicate an eagerness for smarter, more efficient systems. It's a unique window of opportunity that opens perhaps once in a multi-decade chance to redefine an entire industry's operational backbone. Team: KS, a BITS Pilani grad and successful startup co-founder, and Ayantika, an IIT alumni and tech expert, bring extensive coding and product development expertise together bringing about over a decade of technical expertise. Sneha ( that‚Äôs me), with over a decade of experience in supply chain management and lean manufacturing within the construction industry, has lived the pain of using ERPs in this industry.

2024. digistain : In the global fight against breast cancer, Digistain stands at the forefront, offering a beacon of hope to millions. Our journey began at Imperial College London, where ground-breaking research gave birth to a technology poised to revolutionize breast cancer diagnostics. The Challenge: Every year, breast cancer affects 2.3 million individuals globally. Post-surgery, 60% of patients are advised to undergo genomic testing, an expensive and time-consuming process monopolized by a single lab in the U.S., costing around $4,000 and taking nearly two months. Consequently, only 5% undergo this vital testing. The rest, unable to access this crucial diagnostic step, often resort to chemotherapy‚Äîa treatment that, in one in four cases, is more harmful than the cancer itself. Our Solution: Digistain addresses this critical gap. Our technology transforms the current diagnostic process by enabling hospitals to analyze patient samples in-house using existing equipment, supplemented with our innovative technology. This approach offers near-instantaneous decision-making data, a stark contrast to the existing month-long waits. Central to our technology is a proprietary algorithm that identifies a unique spectral fingerprint of the tumour in the infrared spectrum, providing a personalized risk score. This score guides oncologists in selecting the most effective, individualized treatment plans, potentially reducing unnecessary chemotherapy and its harmful side effects. Impact and Potential: Our solution not only challenges the status quo in technology but also in accessibility. In a landmark government-commissioned study, Digistain demonstrated clinical evidence on par with the market leader, but at a fraction of the cost and time. Already making waves in clinical practice globally, with insurance reimbursement at leading cancer centers, our technology represents a paradigm shift in cancer care. Recognized by the Institute of Physics, the Royal Society, and Imperial College for our innovative contributions, and supported by entities like the NHS, Y Combinator, and the European Investment Bank, Digistain is more than a company‚Äîit‚Äôs a movement towards equitable, effective cancer treatment. With the potential to democratize access to life-saving diagnostics, Digistain is not just envisioning a better future for cancer patients; we are actively creating it.

2039. attain : Attain is a one-stop shop for convenience store owners to buy inventory across all their suppliers with higher reliability, price transparency, and product discovery. On average, store owners buy products from over 10-15 different suppliers each week. This painful process involves shopping in massive warehouses or spending hours working with wholesaler‚Äôs sales representatives (who sometimes don‚Äôt even show up). As a result, stores waste countless hours ordering products through extremely inefficient and tedious processes. These store owners are also severely impacted by inventory shortages and revenue loss which many times results in them downsizing their business or shutting them down completely. Attain solves this problem by providing a single app to purchase products across all of their suppliers, resulting in a one-stop shop for inventory. By aggregating inventory across a multitude of suppliers and wholesalers, Attain helps stores save significant time and money while allowing them to focus on what they do best - growing their businesses.

Our granular, multiperil model allows us to offer a superior policy over the standard market including: - coverage for if your place is flooded by a neighbor - Replacement Cost Coverage (meaning new stuff for your old) - All Risk coverage for high value items you tell us about - including computers (almost no one does that amazingly) - added coverage for mold removal Our MGA business model allows us to be capital efficient, "renting" capacity as we need it. All this adds up to our government approved pricing being 40-60% cheaper on average than that of our competitors.

2184. guse : Guse is the first fully multiplayer AI canvas for individuals and teams to work on research, writing, reports, and decks.

Individuals or teams can work, iterate, and collaborate on research, reports, etc. - then instantly export any canvas out to any format (yes, even fully fleshed out slides!).

2199. extern : At Extern, we‚Äôre solving the experience gap. Extern created the remote Externship, a skill-building work experience that is easier for students to access, and easier for companies to run, than an internship. Our mission is to help anyone discover and launch their career through professional experiences available anywhere at any time. Since 2020, we‚Äôve created and powered Externships on behalf of companies from Fortune 500s to startups that have enabled tens of thousands of students to build real experience and open doors to incredible opportunity. After spending $100K on average for a 4-year degree, graduates find that almost 40% of entry level jobs on Linkedin required 3+ years of work experience. Internships are how many college students get this kind of experience, but the demand for good internships outstrips the supply. Internship programs are difficult to scale, they favor students who already have social capital, and they‚Äôre time-consuming for employers to run. Externships are short, online, project-based work experiences that employers can offer to hundreds of students using less resource and employee time than it would take to support an intern. Extern makes the complex process of running an Externship completely turnkey with software and industry experts which in turn makes professional experience more accessible to more students. By making work experience more accessible, Extern is driving the rapid mobility and upskilling needed for a new economy. We envision a world where anyone can access work experience as a form of education ‚Äì no matter their background, experience, or socio-economic status. Come join our movement to reshape work, education, and credentialing for future generations with the Externship. Extern was born out of a pivot from Paragon One (W17) which initially focused on providing students with a career center-as-a-service platform, connecting them with industry professionals to receive career coaching and guidance. Backed by Y Combinator, Foundation Capital, Launch Fund, University Ventures, and Learn Capital.

2224. yuma-ai : ## What is Yuma AI? Yuma is automating customer support by providing an AI Support Agent orchestration platform. Yuma provides autonomous AI agents dedicated to customer service and e-commerce. We integrate directly with help desk software (Zendesk, Kustomer, Gorgias, etc.) and focus on helping large Shopify merchants deal with their high volume of support requests. Top merchants using Yuma can automate up to 60% of their support tickets fully autonomously. ## Why do Shopify merchants need Yuma? There are thousands of large Shopify merchants around the world generating $10M+ a year. Most of them have taken over some niches and are great at what they do: selling their products. But they all have one thing in common: they all hate customer support. It's a burden for them and a huge source of cost, as they receive hundreds of requests per day. Some of them have dozens of support agents on staff, usually offshore, and the overall quality is still often pretty poor while staff turnover remains high. Those merchants have been promised automation for years but have always been disappointed by the outcome. As customers, we have all had to live through a terrible support automation experience before, so this is no secret, and everyone knows that the current state of the technology is quite bad. ## Yuma is solving this in a few ways: Yuma isn't just another RAG chatbot. Our platform provides autonomous AI agents dedicated to support and ecommerce. These agents are powered by knowledge, follow processes, and are managed by our in-house AI orchestration technology. This ensures safety, control, and quality at every step. We believe that to truly automate customer support, we must develop a platform that mimics the actions of a human support agent. That's exactly what we've been doing. Currently, our top merchants are automating 60% of their support tickets through Yuma. Yuma can fetch information from external services and take actions in other apps as needed to resolve each ticket. We are laser-focused on building the best AI support agent platform and aim to achieve 80% true automation in the next few months. ## Fun Fact Yuma got started by accident. This is my third YC startup after Socialcam (W12) and Triplebyte (S15). I released Yuma as a prototype for fun in mid-December 2022 and was overwhelmed with demo requests. That's when I knew I was onto something and had to turn this into a real company, once again.

2251. storia-ai : With AI increasingly automating away code generation, software engineers will spend more time reading, judging, and architecting code rather than writing it. Storia is building an open-source copilot that knows a company's codebase and its context. We are starting with Sage, a Perplexity-like agent for helping developers understand, judge, and generate software. Given an existing codebase, developers can ask Sage questions such as: 1) Given my project‚Äôs SLA and latency constraints, what is the appropriate underlying vector database to use? How would I incorporate it into my existing codebase? 2) Why should I pick Redis over Milvus as my underlying vector store? 3) Does this codebase in our organization still work and what steps are required for a complex integration with another library? Sage‚Äôs answers are directly supported by documentation and external references like GitHub, Stack Overflow, technical design documents, and project management software, preventing hallucinations. Today, Sage has up-to-date knowledge about open-source repositories (indexed daily). Tomorrow it will have a deep understanding of every line of code on the Internet. For teams, Sage will know about your private codebase too. No group has yet solved how to build an AI system that comprehends a codebase and its context and can empower every developer to architect better code, faster. This requires new research advances because vanilla RAG and out-of-the-box LLMs aren‚Äôt going to cut it. We have 20+ years of software engineering and AI research experience.

Patients travel 100 miles waiting for hours to get few minutes with the doctors. They have no easy means to manage all the toxicities and symptoms they get once they are back home.

2498. lucy-goods-inc : If it isn‚Äôt bad enough that smokers don‚Äôt realize the scientific facts about nicotine, most non-tobacco nicotine products are poorly designed and unappealing to use. The leading gum is sold like a pharmaceutical drug, with flavoring and packaging to match. Vapes provide a cumbersome, over-the-top experience ‚Äî with use as tightly restricted as cigarette smoking itself, but more juvenile, conspicuous, and highly addictive. People want, and deserve, a better way. Therefore, we want to deliver nicotine users a superior experience, and at the same time give them a way to transition out of feeling dependent. In a better society, people wouldn‚Äôt carry around the sensation that they‚Äôre stuck with an involuntary habit. Our mission isn‚Äôt to encourage nicotine use among people who haven‚Äôt started. Unlike certain vapes or other products, ours isn‚Äôt the sort coveted by underage users on social media. Our mission is to alleviate the harm related to tobacco ‚Äî first and foremost, by switching people away from the most harmful products. So, at Lucy, we take an evidence based view of nicotine. Nicotine‚Äôs pleasurable properties make it an inevitable part of modern society. Therefore, minimizing harm in all nicotine products is key, in addition to giving people products and strategies for cessation. We feel that, as 1,300 people are dying of tobacco related illnesses every day in the US, the most important and immediate step toward a better society is giving nicotine consumers products they enjoy using that will cause less harm. Our first product is designed to appeal to smokers and encourage them to switch. And, looking ahead, we hope to secure approval in the future as a clinically proven smoking cessation aid, while continuing to participate in the FDA‚Äôs public hearings around how NRTs are best regulated. Our goals are simple: because harm reduction is a better strategy around nicotine delivery than abstinence or prohibition, we want to help improve public health ‚Äî and reduce its costs ‚Äî through a superior pure nicotine product.

2781. atomic-alchemy : Atomic Alchemy is building a bank of reactors to produce the nuclear material that goes into nuclear medicine. Radiopharmaceuticals are vitally important in biological tracers, diagnostic imaging, and cancer treatments.

Five of these reactors are 45-65 years old and are quickly coming to the end of their operational life.

Soon one app become four, and before we knew it we had lots of happy users and lots of great coverage by all sorts of people such The Telegraph, Wired, O'Reilly and MacFormat. Being a friendly bunch, we took the time to chat with the hundreds of you who said hello, and we found you all had the same problem: gyms were either too expensive, too daunting, too boring or too inconvenient.

2992. creatoros : We build tools that allows enterprises verify information about a user *before* processing it - whether it is processed by a human or an AI agent. Traditionally, these verifications including but not limited to background checks cost ~$10. Using our advancements in AI and Cryptography, we're able to send that cost to a few cents. This enables enterprises to do verification at scale, earlier in their work-flows, and enables new kinds of businesses - which were not performing these verifications because of prohibitively high costs. For example, it makes no sense that a recruiter does a candidate's document verification and background checks AFTER the candidate has cleared all the interviews. That's because that verification is cumbersome and expensive. They can't afford to verify all the candidates at the top of the funnel. Many such workflows are ripe for disruption. Another example of a product that was not possible before. A dating app uses our tools to verify the users' information - including their employment, education and financial background. This was something that would have been too expensive to verify at a $10 pricepoint where the ARPU is only $8. Not only that, we're designing the tools ground up - so that AI agents can utilize these verifications before ingesting information, so that they take action basis truthful information. We have 3 tools 1. BlueCheck : our flagship product for background verification. The cheapest option to verify users' employment, education and financial background. A few cents instead of a few tens of dollars. Several Billion Dollar+ revenue companies are customers. A solution designed for enterprises that works out of the box! 2. Reclaim Protocol : our underlying infrastructure that makes BlueCheck possible. With advancements in cryptography, specifically zero knowledge proofs - our research over the last 3 years have resulted in inventing a new cryptographic primitive called zkTLS, which allows us to verify information from any website using the cryptography of the existing internet pipes (TLS). This is our secret sauce! 3. Questbook : our dog-fooding tool. Questbook is a tool to give out research and open source software development grants. These grants are reviewed by AI agents that we built inhouse. The biggest scam people try is to fake who they are when they are applying for grants. We dog-food our own tools to make sure we verify all the claims the users are making when they apply for grants. Our tools secure more than $10M of grants being given out on the platform. So it's high stakes, and it works!

Every time a user make any digital transaction, we round off the amount to the nearest 10 INR and invest it for them into a diversified portfolio, automatically. 400M millennials in India don't invest because they don't have enough time, knowledge or access to large capital. With Spenny, they just connect the card and invest every time they spend. We're growing 67% WoW since launch, with 3,000+ users and $15,000 in AUM. Indians put $500Bn into their bank accounts annually. We charge 1.75% of the AUM for investments. That's a direct ~$9Bn market in India alone. Potentially every time a user makes a transaction, we make money. And in that sense, the timing for Spenny couldn't have been better: 1 Trillion+ transactions are expected in 2021 because of factors like Whatsapp launching its P2P payments in India for its 400M users. And the emergence of UPI means every Indian has a virtual bank account now. More interesting revenue models develop from the transaction data insights of our users.

3149. cero : At Cero, we solve specific coordination tasks between hospitals and patients, such as appointment confirmations and last minute cancellations, by automatically communicating with patients over WhatsApp. For example, a patient can confirm and reschedule their appointment without needing to call anyone. Almost half of the medical appointments in Latin America are missed because patients simply do not show up. This ranges from missing a regular dentist check to missing an expensive MRI scan. With increasing pressure to improve access to care in developing countries, optimizing communication and coordination with patients is a key task to achieve. This is a massive problem especially in places where most people don't know how to effectively use self-service mediums (or are too busy to use them). We bootstrapped the company and we are profitable. As of August 2021 we have $97K in monthly revenue from 15 clients with a CMRG of 20% in the last year. We have 100% logo retention and we grow with our clients. We are currently coordinating over 600,000 medical appointments every month, just in Chile. This problem represents a $3.5B market opportunity in Latin America only. Latin America has 650M people, each one having an average of 3 medical consultations per year. We charge for every time we effectively communicate with a patient. We plan to handle several coordination interactions with every patient for each consultation, which considers a roadmap of scheduling, confirming, booking, reimbursements, payments, among others. We are a team mixing strong knowledge about the healthcare industry with deep technical skills. Felipe (CEO) is a former dentist that has led deep changes in healthcare payments in Chile. Mauricio (CTO) and Jorge (R&D), both PhD in Computer Science, led the creation of the most advanced Spanish Language Neural Network used daily by scientists and practitioners in LatAm (BETO: Spanish BERT). In a weekend project, Mauricio and Jorge automated the communication with students attending a summer school obtaining impressive engagement.

3275. blacksmith : Blacksmith helps companies run their continuous integration (CI) up to twice as fast, at half the cost. We do this by running their CI on high performance gaming CPUs. - Engineering productivity is often marred by slow CI that grows quadratically with the size of the engineering organization. - On top of this, companies pay high markups to run CI on the hyperscalers. - Consequently, companies have to run their CI on spot instances to keep costs in check. Since spot instances can get pre-empted at any point, running CI reliably on them requires [significant engineering investment](https://www.rippling.com/blog/how-rippling-used-spot-instances-to-save-and-scale-ci-cd). Blacksmith offers CI compute that is more performant, cheaper, and reliable. With Blacksmith, companies do not have to think about CI as they scale. We are starting with GitHub Actions - today's most popular and fastest-growing CI system. With a one-line change, companies can run their CI up to twice as fast on our high-performance hardware. In addition to this, Blacksmith provides colocated warm caches along with optimizations for common CI workloads (like building and pushing Docker images). Aayush, JP and Aditya have gained deep systems and product knowledge from their time at Cockroach Labs and Faire respectively. Both these companies, with several hundred engineers, were spending in the order of millions of dollars on their CI. Yet they were riddled with slow CI and actively seeking out cheaper and faster alternatives. Blacksmith offers exactly this alternative, at a time where being lean is table-stakes for most companies.

3278. craniometrix : Alzheimer‚Äôs is tough. And while there is no cure, getting help should be 100x easier than it is today. We‚Äôve raised over $6 million to solve that problem. When someone is going through the disease, there are many different things they need help with (i.e. memory issues, depression, fall risk, safety in the home, etc). The primary person responsible for that care is one of the patient‚Äôs loved ones ‚Äì usually a child or a spouse. That‚Äôs a really difficult thing for the loved one to do. It‚Äôs stressful, time consuming, and difficult. If we can make their lives easier, we can not only improve their experience but also create better patient outcomes.

With this technology, we can take any patient derived cell, whether it be blood, skin or fat and reprogram (convert) them into medically relevant cell types. Our first objective is to cure hair loss by using our reprogramming technology to make new hair (patent pending). This is different from everything currently available on the market because the hair loss industry is focused on maintaining the hair that you already have, but no one is trying to produce NEW hair, de novo. After hair, we envision using our cellular reprogramming technique to make any cell, any tissue or any organ on demand to replace what is lost as we age.

3303. gantto : Gantto was conceived to fill one obvious gap in our weekly management routine. Each week we would collect status information based upon what was really happening inside the organization and then update our project models to reflect and digest the changes. Then we would spend tedious hours manually creating presentations based upon the same underlying project data that we had already updated. After a long search for a good solution we set out to create our own. Gantto is a play on words on gantt chart √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú the most commonly used visual representation of project schedules. Gantt charts take their name after Henry Gantt, who popularized them in 1910. In reality they were originally conceived by Karol Adamiecki, a Polish economist / engineer who invented them in 1896 and named them harmonograf.
3304. compgun : Compgun is founded on the simple premise that sales commissions are simultaneously the sales organization's single biggest strategic lever and its largest expense. At previous companies, Tim and Jake were amazed by the effectiveness of sales commissions in rallying teams around new strategic priorities and business objectives. At the same time, they were shocked by how primitively commission expenses are often managed. Most businesses administer commissions with Excel and email, making it nearly impossible for sales reps or their managers to track how they are pacing throughout the month, let alone which transactions were included in a previous period‚Äôs paycheck. Compgun‚Äôs mission is to stand the status quo on it‚Äôs head by providing real-time performance tracking and insight to every member of the sales org.

3340. ophelia : Ophelia helps people quit opioids without going to rehab. We offer online doctor‚Äôs visits, withdrawal medication prescriptions, and support for long-term recovery, using a protocol 6x more effective than most rehabs (2/3rds of which don't have doctors). More than 3 million Americans are addicted to opioids, but 80% are not getting help, due to jobs, families, and privacy concerns. Meanwhile, there's a proven treatment that increases survival rates by 600%, and it's low cost, discreet, and convenient. It's called MAT, and it looks like treatment for anxiety or depression: medication plus therapy. However, doctors need a special waiver to prescribe the medication, which fewer than 5% of them have, so it's difficult to get, and most people are buying it on the street. Sadly, drug dealers aren't doctors: every 11 minutes another American dies of an opioid overdose, now the #1 cause of death for Americans under 50. Ophelia is replacing rehab with telemedicine, using proven science and a consumer-first approach. The opioid treatment market in the U.S. is $15B, and 85% of opioid addicts have insurance that pays for it. We're treating roughly 400 patients with thousands more waiting.

Its scope is limited to physical storage, and security is lost as soon as an application or query loads the data.

3400. pluto-markets : Technology is a massive enabler for stock market participation. This was the case when the phone, the internet and apps were invented granting access for more people. For 100m Europeans living in countries without the Euro however, there has been no innovation for the past 30 years.

We are on a mission to drive financial inclusion by bridging the innovation gap for the overlooked regions of the EU.
3401. almond : Almond is like One Medical but for women‚Äôs health: we make it easy to get great ObGyn care fast, both at our in-person offices and over telehealth.

3411. dropleaf : Dropleaf is a response to an industry that could be so much better than it is. They want to provide everyone with a never ending stream of transformative experiences, but doing that is going to require us to change the space around games.

3415. matrubials-inc : Matrubials is an anti-infectives company, focused on human milk peptides as therapeutics to address antimicrobial resistance and modern diseases. Currently the global rise in severe bacterial infections and the drying pipeline of effective treatments are burdensome for healthcare and economics. Sculpted by evolution, milk, first food for the newborn, provides an exemplary solution to address the nutritive and protective challenges an infant is faced with. The anti-pathogenic molecules from milk can be developed into therapeutics geared towards all-age diseases. Our first indication is bacterial vaginosis, a bacterial dysbiosis related inflammation that results in recurrent infections, disruption of homeostasis and long-term clinical complications in women of reproductive age, including but not limited to preterm births, fertility issues and increased rates of STDs. Our next inflection point is the evaluation of rapidly acting and selective candidate peptides in pre-clinical host impact and early safety studies, which can aid clinical and portfolio development towards topical applications.
3416. markprompt : Close customer support tickets faster with AI. We‚Äôre building AI infrastructure to power customer support at scale. With Markprompt, companies can automate customer support, scale without increasing headcount, and deliver exceptional user experiences. Scaling customer support with headcount is expensive, with human resources accounting for 90%+ of customer support expenses. On top of that, customer support agents often burn out leading to turnover and reduced quality. As companies grow, so does their expert knowledge, which is hard to access at scale and makes keeping employees up-to-date nearly impossible. Markprompt addresses the root of the information access problem by indexing all available knowledge within a company, setting the foundation for a robust system of record to feed the AI. Built from the ground up with an API-first approach, Markprompt provides SDKs (such as React hooks and components) and no-code tools to enable integrations at all touchpoints in the customer journey.

3423. zergo : 
3424. dex : Dex is a personal CRM that reminds you to keep in touch with the people you would otherwise forget. Dex helps turn your acquaintances into your allies. Going beyond the superficiality of social networks requires commitment. If you remember to keep in touch thoughtfully, you can turn the interesting person you met at a networking event into a friend that has your back. I built Dex after failing to keep up with the tools I tried (Airtable, Notion, etc) for relationship management. Installing an actual CRM like Hubspot felt like a wrong fit for my informal relationships -- these people were 'my team,' not customers. Dex is a lightweight personal CRM that‚Äôs easy to stick with. Key to Dex is a Chrome extension that enables you to manage relationships while you‚Äôre in Facebook, Messenger, Twitter, and the social apps you already use. Dex can also send you actionable reminders (daily, or based on your calendar events) to log your interactions for next time. By using Dex, you can: - Build stronger relationships, by sending you a nudge to follow-up. - Be more thoughtful, by helping you remember where you left off. - Become a superconnector, by making connections you wouldn‚Äôt otherwise remember.
3425. pronto : PRONTO is the first RIDE-SHARING + DELIVERY platform for SECOND-TIER cities in LATAM. In second-tier cities all transactions are paid with cash, this is why the Uber model doesn¬¥t work (since they have to collect their revenue from commissions). We solved this by creating a subscription model where drivers pay a monthly recurring subscription of 59 to 99 USD depending on their monthly revenue. This also generates a higher LTV with low CAC as well as high engagement and fidelity ratios. Traction: Since our launch, we have achieved over 2,000,000 processed trips with more than 200,000 users, we bootstrapped until we achieved half a million trips and entered YC. Market Size: There are over 14,000 second-tier cities in LATAM, with more than 500 million people without any access to ride-sharing or technology platforms at all.
3426. wefunder : We help everyone invest in startups that they care about. We believe that when all Americans can invest in innovation, the world will be a better place. And soon, our dream will become a reality. Thanks to the JOBS Act, everyone ‚Äî not just the wealthy ‚Äî can invest as little as $100 in the startups they care about. Not only does this open up the pool of investors, and increase the amount of great ideas that get funded, but it allows startups to grow an army of passionate investors who truly want to see them succeed. Second tier VC‚Äôs will become obsolete as startups tap their lead users and customers for quick early investments.
3427. asseta : Asseta is an online marketplace for used capital equipment and parts. We utilize innovative software to bring buyers and sellers together so you can efficiently and transparently collaborate during equipment transactions. Our web based platform ensures easy price discovery for interested parties and high touch customer service.

The incumbent firms rely on large sales forces and the fragmentation of the market to charge huge margins. We believe in a better solution. Founded in 2013, Asseta is Y Combinator backed startup based in Newport Beach. For more information, visit www.asseta.com.

3429. selera-medical : Heart failure impacts millions worldwide and is associated with poor quality of life and high mortality rates. Because the heart cannot pump efficiently, fluids buildup around the body. Fluid overload is the main driver behind patient symptoms (shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, etc.) and hospitalizations. Our minimally invasive device leverages the body's innate fluid management system to offload trapped fluid and prevent subsequent rounds of buildup. The one-time procedure has sustained effect -- keeping patients healthier, happier, and out of the hospital.
3430. velos : Velos helps non-technical operations teams automate complex, manual back-office tasks with AI workers instead of overseas teams.

For example, a leading home-buying platform is using telli to fully automate their pre-qualification. We are serving customers in energy, real estate, medical products, and home services. You might think that these B2C companies want to do more self-serve and less outreach. But the truth is outbound calls are what really drive conversion. Historically, managing these calls has been complex and expensive‚Äîcosting companies hundreds of thousands of dollars. With telli, for the first time, B2C companies can automate the role of a pre-sales agent, end to end.

3445. yoneda-labs : Yoneda Labs provides software to help chemists optimise reactions. When chemists make a drug or a material, we help them figure out the best reaction parameters such as temperature, concentration and catalyst. When Jan was working at chemical labs, he experienced the struggle of spending weeks guessing reaction conditions. We then started experimenting with ML to speed up the process. Now, as a team of three friends from the University of Cambridge, we‚Äôve spent the last month combining our domain expertise in Computer Science, Machine Learning and Chemistry to develop state of the art models for reaction optimisation. Although ML is becoming well established in other fields, current chemical models generalise poorly and require lots of programming experience. We make our models easily accessible to chemists in the lab. Finding the right conditions quickly allows pharmaceutical companies to test more drugs, and finding better optima makes manufacturing process cheaper and more environmentally friendly.

3597. fogbender : Fogbender helps B2B companies support customer teams: think Intercom meets Slack's shared channels.

3894. hypermile : Hypermile is on a mission to improve trucking efficiency, sustainability and safety by developing an AI driver assistance system üöõ üåéüå±. Today, fuel is the main cost component for logistics operators, accounting for >1/3 of all operating costs. Driving behavior is a key factor affecting overall fuel consumption and can increase fuel use by up to 35%. However, current solutions are not cost effective, so logistics operators are constantly looking for new solutions. In addition, logistics operators are under huge sustainability pressure, as Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) are responsible for 16% of the UK's transport emissions but only 5% of the miles travelled. While electric vehicle sales for passenger vehicles are on the rise, the same can't be said for long-haul HGVs due to high initial cost and limited range, making it impractical for logistic purposes. With this problem in mind, we aim to leverage the latest AI techniques to improve the fuel efficiency of diesel trucks today, and increase the range of zero-emission trucks of the future. Our product Hypermile Co-Pilot is a retrofittable AI cruise control for commercial vehicles focused on controlling the speed of the truck efficiently. We have trained the AI algorithms to learn the best techniques for saving fuel: anticipating how traffic flow will change, optimising speed based on the road gradient and maximizing vehicle coasting. As a result, we can reduce diesel consumption by 11% and extend the range of battery-electric vehicles by 15%. The long term vision is to incrementally build higher levels of autonomy with the next milestone being a Level-3 autonomous trucking solution. The company was founded in May 2020 and raised a $1.5M pre-seed round in May 2021 from Y Combinator, Greg Brockman (CTO of OpenAI), Luc Vincent (former Executive VP of Autonomous Driving at Lyft Level 5) and others.

3903. riviera : Riviera builds AI voice agents that let hotels spend less time answering phone calls and more time helping guests. Our system handles front-desk operator calls, in-room dining orders, and reservations. It answers every question instantly and in any language, 24/7. We‚Äôre solving a problem that older phone systems and IVR (Interactive Voice Recordings) can't: guests hate not being able to talk to someone immediately, but hotels can‚Äôt dedicate additional staff to manage phone lines. Voice AI has always seemed out of reach for hotels because their technology infrastructure is often fragmented, with reservation systems, loyalty programs, and in-house operations software that weren‚Äôt designed with voice AI in mind. Riviera addresses this by integrating seamlessly with existing hotel software providers and using human-sounding voice models that are highly trained on data specific to each hotel and department. Hotels spend over $100 billion annually on staffing and lose potential revenue when phone lines are overwhelmed or callers hang up. By enabling hotels to handle unlimited calls, day or night, Riviera unlocks additional revenue and eases labor challenges.

3938. launchpad-toys : We're creating digital toys and tools that empower kids to create, learn & share their ideas through play. Give a young child a couple of toys or a box of crayons and he or she is likely to play for hours, deeply engrossed in an imaginary world. In both art and dramatic play, children construct settings, create fictional characters, and act out fantastic storylines that would be the envy of many Hollywood scriptwriters. Yet, ask that same child to write out a story in a blank notebook or a word processor and you would be lucky to capture a fraction of the depth and splendor of his or her imagination. Play inspires and scaffolds the creative process from an early age, but there is a persistent gap between the origins of imaginative play (ages 4-5) and kids' adoption of the formal discipline of creative writing (ages 8-10). At Launchpad Toys, we're using mobile devices like the iPad to bridge this gap between informal and formal learning, to harness the power of play to help children capture and share their ideas with other kids around the world. Our first product, Toontastic an app for the iPad, is a creative learning tool that blends constructionist and social development theories to empower young children to create, learn, and share their ideas through play.

Yo is a three-time-acquired serial entrepreneur with a McKinsey background. Misato is a previous head of R&D at Mercari. Tailor is the first YC company fully based in Japan. **The Problem** In today's business world, old ERP systems just don't keep up.

On Simmer, we tell you the best reviewed dishes across all delivery apps. You first choose your dish on Simmer, and the delivery companies just take care of logistics. Through this, we are able to charge affiliate revenue for every order. No one has done this before because determining a city‚Äôs best dishes requires millions of users to leave dish reviews.

4322. oncobox : Oncobox believes that many late-stage cancer patients are dying prematurely because doctors lack a data-driven tool to help them decide which drugs currently on the market would most effectively fight individual patients‚Äô specific cancers. That‚Äôs where Oncobox comes in. Oncobox is low-cost personalized genetic profiling to help doctors decide which drug to use. In a recent study conducted by leading cancer researchers in Europe and Asia on 900 patients with various late-stage cancers, Oncobox increased the effectiveness of targeted therapies from 25% to 64%. How does Oncobox work? Over 150 targeted cancer drugs are currently on the market. But deciding which of these drugs to give to late-stage cancer patients is not a simple task. Cancer doctors are in a race against the clock. They don‚Äôt always know which medication will be most effective for their patients. Because these drugs are expensive and typically have significant side effects, they can‚Äôt just try them all. Because of these barriers, targeted cancer therapies are effective only 25% of the time, and 70% of patients with late-stage cancers die due to the toxic side effects of ineffective drugs. Oncobox Dx analyses tumor DNA, RNA, and molecular pathways using algorithms to distinguish which molecular targets are the most crucial for individual cases. Doctors receive a clinically actionable report that shows them which drugs are likely to be most effective on the patient. We actively seek partners from pharma, hospitals/clinicians, payers, and genomic centers. Feel free to contact us at hello@oncobox.com. Our team and the scientific advisory board consisting of leading scientists and researchers from UCLA, Stanford, Johns Hopkins University, Boston University, Tufts University, and Rutgers University.

4349. sunlight : Sunlight is an API to change the card-on-file with apps and subscription services. Fintechs use Sunlight to automatically make their cards top-of-wallet as soon as they're issued. Merchants, service providers and subscriptions-based businesses everywhere now offer their customers the ability to save a debit/credit card on file, so they can pay their bills on time, buy in one click, or earn rewards. In 2021, 79% of consumers worldwide reported already having at least one payment card saved with a service or being open to doing so. In recent years, card-issuing as-a-service has become mainstream: any company can now start their own card business in a matter of weeks. Last year, the number of new payment cards issued was at an all-time high. For users, however, switching banks or opening a new card now comes with an additional hurdle: they need to update their payment info across the internet. On the other side of that equation, card issuers have no visibility or control over the card-on-file updating process, and as a result struggle to get their new users to switch their spend from their old card to the new one, leading to low conversion rates and missed revenue opportunities. Until Sunlight. With our universal get-your-card-on-file API, FIs can now offer their users, at any point in their journey, a quick and easy way to update their debit/credit card info everywhere they shop or pay online, without ever leaving their Apps. The Sunlight API works on every platform that has a card-on-file option (think Uber, Amazon, Netflix, DoorDash, Starbucks and so many more‚Ä¶), is as seamless as a Plaid connection, and always gets the card number and CVV code right on the first try!

4377. mica-ai : Mica builds AI Agents that automate B2B sales. Our agents analyze sales calls, generate tailored collateral, and follow up until the deal is closed. The founders met at UC Berkeley, and at our last jobs, we saw that the best sales reps weren‚Äôt just great at selling‚Äîthey were elite content creators. They crafted tailored collateral like decks and highlight videos for each buyer, and their champions used this info to advocate for purchasing their product within their companies. However, because this takes more than 30 minutes per call, even the best reps could only do tailored follow-ups for a few clients, leaving millions in lost deals. Mica‚Äôs agents reduce that time to less than a minute. This lets top performers do A+ work on every deal and helps the rest of the team sell like a top performer. Sales collateral creation and follow-up is a $11b market in the US but this is just our beachhead.

4416. mypetrolpump : Why did we pick this idea to work on? India is a country with 200 mln vehicles (about the same number as USA) but one third the number of gas stations(60K) as compare to USA(160K), The consequence of odd number of fuel stations is long queues of vehicles at the gas stations to fill up, heavily congested Indian roads make it worse. Opening of 100K new fuel stations is practically & economically impossible in urban localities due to rocketing high land prices. And that's how the idea of mobile refueling was conceptualized by founders. Literally "bringing the gas stations to doorsteps". The problem of buying fuel is much more alarming in large volume consumer segments such as Vehicle fleet users like schools, cab rentals, freight logistics operators , tours and travels operators, hospitals, hotels, real estate etc who burn huge amount of dead mileage & loss of productivity while sending all fleet vehicles to gas stations to fill up. Additionally, India has a unique problem of Electricity blackouts. Current avg. is less than 18 hours of a day of electricity in Indian metro cities, which causes more than 20 mln household and commercial buildings running on backup generators which require Diesel. They cant bring the generators to gas stations either therefore they buy Diesel in jerry cans or barrels and transport unsafely. Our solution is solving the desperate & daily need of Indian consumers along with convenience. Do we have domain expertise in this area? Founder is ex veteran of Shell with 9 years of global experience, has complete understanding Oil marketing business. How do you know people need what you're making? We have over 5000 registred large volume customers who are waiting to be served. With our limited number of refueling vehicles ,we could serve max 1200 customers currently. We got all these customers without spending a penny in marketing and promotion. Zero sales efforts. Additionally, we have received over 400 franchisee requests across India where people want to offer mobile refueling service their town validating the demand.

These reviews and votes can be cast from the site's iPhone app or from the service's homepage. The homepage also features a stream of the latest comments to come in from other users, as well as a profile for each restaurant in the system that includes all of its votes and comments. There's also a nifty feature that lets you view a heatmap of your current region, so you can quickly figure out the hot spots in town. The gameplay in GraffitiGeo gives you points for checking into certain locations, similar to FourSquare, but doesn't really let you do anything with them. With GraffitiGeo, you earn points for every action you take, be it voting on a restaurant or leaving a brief comment. Once you've reached a certain point threshold, you can use those points to start a "mob", which you can invite your friends to join. Mobs allow friends to pool their points, which can then be used to acquire territory, which corresponds to actual city blocks. Whenever someone votes on one of the restaurants on the block, the mob gets some street cred too. It's definitely going to be confusing at first, but it also brings a team element to gameplay.

We have generated a database of over 1 million immune cells spanning healthy, cancerous, and autoimmune immune cells and are growing through paid partnerships.

4755. airthium : We build engines that have the potential to slash 33% or worldwide CO2 emissions - cost-effectively. First, we help food and mining companies cut both their heat costs *and* CO2 emissions by replacing gas-fired steam boilers with our proprietary high temperature heat pumps. Our heat pumps make up to 3x more heat with the same amount of electricity, even at up to 1000¬∞F. Once the heat pump market is mature, we will address the seasonal energy storage market. Our storage units are based on the exact same proprietary engine we use for our heat pumps. They work with solar and wind, and replace lithium-ion batteries, fossil-fired power plants, CO2 capture and storage, and fuel procurement, with a cheaper, sustainable and more reliable alternative, which can be sited anywhere. The first opportunity is a high-margin market worth 3% of worldwide CO2. The second is a much bigger market worth 30% of worldwide CO2. By the time all cars become electric, it will be even more. Our key is we are building the first Stirling engine to reach 86% of the Carnot efficiency, compared to 64% for the state of the art. We do all that while significantly decreasing costs, and increasing reliability. Please see Airthium's website for more information.

4785. fiber-ai : Fiber AI automates SDR and BDR prospecting & outbound sales workflows using AI. Enterprises choose our AI sales platform because we automatically find prospects, research them, and hyper-personalize outbound messages that get 80% open rates, which is 4x the industry standard (our AISDR / AIBDR platform 2-4x's the reply rates you are currently getting). Our AI sales platform consists of 3 core components: First, Fiber AI manages domain and email health to achieve 80% open rates. We configure cold email infrastructure to maximize email deliverability. Our product will automatically configure your DNS records, warm up your emails (email warmup), orchestrate emails to send optimally across all your accounts, run multi-layer email bounce detection (email waterfall), and modify each outgoing cold outreach to ensure your cold outbound sales emails don't trigger spam filters. Second, we automate sales lead generation with dynamic audiences (AI powered sales assistant, AI based SDR). We have B2B company data on 60 million B2B companies and 800 million B2B contacts, sourced from dozens of data providers (i.e. think sources like BuiltWith, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, SemRush, Apollo data, and more). This allows you to precisely segment your audience by the companies you care about and exclude everyone else. Our audiences are dynamic (i.e., account based marketing, account based sales, ABM), meaning we continuously look for prospects matching your targeting criteria and add them to your audience to run our automated outbound sales sequences. This automates manual workflows you might be running on platforms like Clay or Persana. You can also create an audience once based on intent signals (i.e., GTM or go-to-market signals, sales intelligence) and put your outreach on autopilot. Lastly, our AI sales copilot (AI sales agent, AI based BDR) enables AI powered hyper-personalized emails that boost response rates. The biggest debate in sales is choosing between relevancy and personalization‚Äînow you don‚Äôt have to. We search far and wide to find the ‚Äúgolden nugget‚Äù of information to connect with your prospect, and then use GPT-4 to write hyper personalized email sequences that dramatically increase reply rates and book meetings. Because of these core differences, we stand out from competitors. Products like apollo io have poor email deliverability rates that ruin email health long-term. Existing email outbound tools like amplemarket, reply io, marketo, and outreach io don't scale well and restrict you to small volumes of outbound emails. AI features to autopilot campaigns are missing in products like smartlead ai, instantly, unify gtm, penguin ai, and warmly ai. Currently, our philosophy is to allow AI to 100-1000x your team's output while maintaining extremely high email quality. AI sales copilots like reggie ai, aisdr, artisan ai / artisan sdr / artisan bdr, and others let gpt use AI to generate the entire email, which results in poor outbound email quality since SDRs/BDRs don't have fine-tune controls on the personalization.

Directly reducing craving or positive reinforcement is a successful treatment strategy for addiction. Methadone or buprenorphine (Suboxone) are key examples of this for opioid use disorder. However, these types of medications can be addictive themselves. This has been a major hurdle for medication development for cocaine addiction and has led to many leaders in the addiction space to abandon the dopamine transporter as a target. At EncepHeal, we believe that the dopamine transporter should not be abandoned and instead focusing on fixing the abuse liability problem. Therefore with our partners at the National Institutes of Health, we have shown that these new, allosteric modulators at the dopamine transporter do not display addictive tendencies in animal models. They are also effective at curbing cocaine addiction. Our management team has two co-founders, Omeed Rahimi and Aaron Lazarus, as well as an experienced addiction pharmacologist as their research officer. The team has an advisory board with entrepreneurial and addiction drug development experience as well as expert partners at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a subset of the NIH, and Wake Forest.

5009. peer5 : Peer5's P2P CDN improves content delivery for live and on demand video streams. As video streaming continues to become more mainstream and the streams themselves become HD and 4K, traditional CDNs struggle to deliver high quality viewing experiences. Many publishers try to keep up with peak demand by paying for more servers, many of which are almost never used and struggle with video playback. Not only is this expensive, but it's also inefficient, which is why at Peer5, we've created a P2P CDN to boost your video streaming capabilities. Our CDN works with your servers to ensure that as your viewership increases, your network gets stronger by offloading bandwidth to our peer network. On average, this has been shown to increase server capacity by 20x, offload 70% of bandwidth, increase viewing time by 30% and decrease instances of rebuffering by 40%. Our video streaming CDN uses emerging technologies, including HTML5 and WebRTC. They require no installation by end users and offer easy integration for content providers. We support many different streaming protocols, players and media servers.

Trained on extensive combat zone datasets, our system processes RF signatures in real-time across multiple frequency bands, catching even sophisticated stealth drones using frequency-hopping protocols. When a threat is detected, the system delivers precise targeting data while maintaining continuous tracking. Our product line includes: - Scout Detector: A handheld drone detector for rapid deployment and portability - Mosaic Sensor Network: A scalable mesh network of RF sensors for detecting, tracking, and mapping drone activity across expansive areas The stakes are severe: along our borders, cartel drones facilitate trafficking that costs thousands of lives annually. In prisons, a single successful drone contraband delivery can trigger facility-wide violence. For critical infrastructure, a coordinated drone strike could cause billions in business interruption losses. Traditional drone defense systems, often priced in the millions, are cost-prohibitive for most organizations. GuardianRF bridges this critical gap with accessible, effective protection. Our AI classification engine recognizes various control protocols including modified ExpressLRS, Crossfire, and DJI variants, providing early warning of threats that traditional systems miss entirely. The system's fully automated detection, tracking, and response mechanisms ensure continuous protection with minimal operational overhead. Built and manufactured in the United States, GuardianRF combines field-proven technology with real-world deployment experience to counter modern drone threats. Whether safeguarding critical infrastructure, securing borders, or supporting defense operations, our systems deliver the comprehensive drone detection capabilities needed for today's security challenges.
